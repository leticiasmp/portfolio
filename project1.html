									<h2>Data cleaning and preparation</h2>
									<p>Data cleaning and preparation was carried out in three steps:</p>
									<p>1. To define the data that would be collected for the project, I first tried to understand the relationship between the tables in the br_tse_eleicoes dataset and the data in each of them.<br>
									Main activities: identifying Primary and Foreign Keys, analyzing duplicate data and identifying null and invalid values.</p>
									<p>2. I identified the criteria used for storing each piece of data in the tables.<br>
									Main activities: analysis of the data computed using SQL queries.</p>
									<p>3. Filtering the data according to the samples to be studied: 2020 elections and 2022 elections.<br>
									Main activities: execution of conditions for filtering the data to be studied using SQL queries.</p>
									<p> Furthermore, it is worth noting that the data provided by the Superior Electoral Court is not rigorously organized, which means that some data is very complex to clean. Therefore, we should consider a margin of error of 2 percentage points for the data presented here.</p>

									<h2>Analysis and visualization</h2>
									<p>So, based on the knowledge acquired in the previous stage, I looked for data that would clarify the issue: what impact do investments by big businessmen in electoral campaigns have on our democracy? How is this reflected in our society?</p>
									<p>Thus, by analyzing the data beforehand, we can conclude that the only metric of success we would have available would be the outcome of the elections and the number of votes. Thus, we took as our object of study:</p>
									<h3>Context</h3>
									<p> 1. Context of elected politicians by level of education, average age, gender and declared income.</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a href="project1-queries.html" class="button">Queries</a></li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Representativeness</h3>
									<p> 1. Representation in candidacies for federal deputy, state deputy, senator, governor and mayor by gender.<br>
										2. Representation in candidacies for federal deputy, state deputy, senator, governor, mayor and councillor by race.<br>
										3. Representation in elections for federal deputies, state deputies, senators, governors, mayors and city councilors by gender.<br>
										4. Representation in the elections of federal deputies, state deputies, senators, governors, mayors and councillors by race.</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a href="project1-queries.html" class="button">Queries</a></li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Investments in applications</h3>
									<p> 1. Total value of donations by source.<br>
										2. Amounts invested in candidacies by electoral fund vs. donations from individuals.<br>
										3. Average amount donated per individual.<br>
										4. Top 10 donors in the 2022 elections.<br>
										5. Percentage of politicians who received 80% of investments from individuals.<br>
										6. Average investment per candidate in general.<br>
										7. Average investment per candidate by race.<br>
										8. Average investment per candidate by gender.<br>
										9. Average investment per candidate by race and gender.<br>
										10. 10 parties that received the most investments from individuals. </p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a href="project1-queries.html" class="button">Queries</a></li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Investments by elected candidates vs non-elected candidates</h3>
									<p> 1. average investment for elected federal deputies vs. non-elected federal deputies.<br>
										2. Average investment for elected state deputy vs unelected state deputy.<br>
										3. Average investment for elected senator vs unelected senator.<br>
										4. Average investment for elected governor vs non-elected governor.<br>
										5. Average investment for elected mayor vs non-elected mayor.<br>
										6. Average investment for elected councillor vs unelected councillor.<br>
										7. Average investment per candidate elected in general vs per candidate not elected in general in 2022.</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a href="project1-queries.html" class="button">Queries</a></li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Investments by elected candidates vs non-elected candidates</h3>
									<p> 1. average investment for elected federal deputies vs. non-elected federal deputies.<br>

									</ul>

									<h2>Main insights found</h2>
									<h3>Elected politicians do not represent Brazilian society and its demands.</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Elected candidates do not reflect the diversity of society, configuring a political landscape mostly made up of rich white men to the exclusion of minorities such as women and black people.</li>
										<li>In the race against gender inequality, we have an average election pattern for women of 15% against 85% for men. In the position of governor, we have a more critical scenario with 7.69% of women against 92.31% of men.</li>
										<li>When it comes to racial inequality, we have a scenario where in some positions almost 50% of candidates are white and 50% are non-white (indigenous, yellow, brown, and black), but when it comes to elected candidates we have an approximate average trend of 30% for non-white people against 70% for white people.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Businessmen take candidates as investments to obtain public funds.</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The top 10 donors for the 2022 elections are lawyers, pastors and businessmen from the footwear, automotive, livestock and health sectors, with their donations averaging R$3,296,259.27.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>The inequality of resources in candidacies impacts the least favored classes in society and favors the dominant classes.</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>When we analyze the donations made by individuals, the public that received the least donations were black women, with an average donation value 4x lower than the public that received the most donations, which was made up of white men. This scenario is reflected in our society, since black women make up the class that suffers most from social inequality.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>The availability of resources influences the number of votes</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Investments in electoral campaigns have an impact on the number of votes, since the resources of elected candidates in general in 2022 amount to almost 7 times more than those of unelected candidates.</li>
										<li>Simone Tebet is a clear example of their impact on decision making, having started her campaign with 2% vote intention and ended with 5% vote intention.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Interventions</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Implementing a law that limits the value of donations to a fixed amount and not proportional to each person's gross income.</li>
										<li>Supervision of the amounts donated to each politician by setting a donation limit in order to equalize their resources with the other politicians and not allow there to be an alarming discrepancy between the candidates.</li>
										<li>Monitoring the political actions of the people who donated the most money to the electoral campaigns of elected politicians.</li>
										<li>Establishing quotas for the election of politicians according to the minorities present in society in a more effective way than the current policy of gender quotas established for candidates.</li>
